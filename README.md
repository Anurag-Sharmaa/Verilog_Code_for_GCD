GCD Computation in Verilog
This repository includes the Verilog HDL implementation and testbench for computing the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of two integers using a hardware description approach.

Description
The project demonstrates a simple and efficient hardware design for GCD computation using the Euclidean algorithm. The code is written in Verilog and verified through a structured testbench.
All technical details, design methodology, simulation results, and implementation considerations are documented in the accompanying PDF file included in this repository.
